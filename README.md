# Bike Sharing Data Analysis and Dashboard üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìä

This project involves analyzing bike-sharing data and building a Streamlit dashboard to visualize various trends in bike rentals. The dashboard showcases insights derived from analyzing the dataset across different factors such as seasons, weekdays, hours, and temperatures.

## Features
1. Seasonal Trends:
- Visualizes bike rental data for each season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
- Compares casual, registered, and total rentals.
- Workday vs. Holiday:
- Displays the average bike rentals for casual and registered users on workdays versus holidays.
2. Hourly Trends:
- Plots the average bike rentals per hour for casual, registered, and total users.
3. Temperature Analysis:
- Shows the impact of temperature (low, medium, high) on total bike rentals.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Framework: Streamlit
- Data Sources: Kaggle (Bike Sharing Dataset)
- Dependencies: Specified in requirements.txt

## Files
- dashboard.py: Main script for the Streamlit dashboard.
- Data Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies needed to run the project.
- URL Dashboard.txt: Contains the deployment link to the live dashboard.

## Insights
1. Seasonality:
- Fall sees the highest rentals, while Spring has the lowest.
2. Workday Patterns:
- Casual rentals peak during holidays, while registered rentals dominate on workdays.
3. Hourly Trends:
- Casual rentals peak in the afternoon, while registered rentals peak during commute hours.
4. Temperature Influence:
- Rentals increase with higher temperatures.
